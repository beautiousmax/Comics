This project started because I wanted a place to view all of my favorite comics in one place. Some of the artists I love only post new comics every other day, once a week, or even more sporadically, so I wanted one place to see everything that's new.

While it won't show past comics (yet), the web app shows the most recent web comic, with its title and the alternate text from a dozen different artists. The page allows to click on the image of comics after you read them to hide them.

The idea is to add other stuff I look at every day to the app, such as to do lists and a news feed.
